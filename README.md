Hi, Iâ€™m @XoRa-Ki ðŸ‘‹. I need to retake my 1st year of engineer school, and because I will have some time to spend I feel it's a good thing to learn more about the things I struggle with. Those are mainly the ways to build a good web app and C lang.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Unity C# (will start learning this at some point but it is not the current priority)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to build a good web app, I will learn more about C lang in September I think
That's it ! Welcome to my profile ðŸ¥°
